# Brain MRI Classification

> This repo contains all the code base for my final year project. The Brain MRI Classification. This project aims to build an accurate and robust ML model for classification of normal and 
abnormal brain MRI images. The basic idea is to use Image Processing as well as Machine Learning Algorithms to implment a novel and improved model; which surpasses other state of the art
models in literature.
> This repository has jupyter notebooks - providing detail notes on the topics - as well as MATLAB codes for implementing Image Processing algorithms to evaluate the best ones for the actual model.
